This is 'acs', an Automatic Channel Selection tool to which
aims to find the optimal channel for initiating radiation
(any beaconing mode of operation) using nl80211. The first
implementation uses simple survey channel data, it will later
adapt to use more data available from chipsets for this purpose.

To build acs, just enter 'make'. If that fails, set the
PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable to allow the Makefile
to find libnl.

'acs' is currently maintained at http://git.kernel.net/acs.git/,
some more documentation is available at:
